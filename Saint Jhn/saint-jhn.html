                Picture me ballin'
                Picture me with the fifth of Henny, somethin' foreign
                Picture me ridin' 'round here with a Benzo
                Picture me blunted with the tints on the window
                You could see by the looks of it I got the feelin'
                I told them bitches I'm somethin' they should believe in
                I told my mama they can't reach me, hit the ceilin'
                Baby, this is just the beginnin', it's pre-season
                I know that you can tell I got it though
                Gotta go get it that's the reflex
                I know you can tell the winners by how we flex
                I ain't playin' with theses niggas ain't no recess
                Next time I look around nigga way up, way up, way up, way up
                Only bad bitches 'round here
                I swear it's only bad bitches 'round here
                I mean it's only real niggas 'round here
                You know it's only real niggas 'round here
                I said, only bad bitches 'round here
                I swear it's only bad bitches 'round here
                I mean it's only real niggas 'round here
                You know it's only real niggas 'round here
                Picture me speedin'
                Picture me rollin' somethin' up to chase the demons
                Ah, that Cohiba really helped me slow the breathin'
                You see these niggas round me they all pledge allegiance
                I never change for nothin', nigga that's some true shit
                I got a mil', you got a mil', that just some crew shit
                They tryin' to stay afloat, I'm tryna build a cruise ship
                I spent a half a decade workin' on the blueprint
                Ay boy, we 'bout to hit the pot of gold
                Gotta and go get it that's the reflex
                I know you can tell the winners by how we flex
                I ain't playin' with theses niggas ain't no recess
                Next time I look around nigga way up, way up, way up, way up
                Only bad bitches 'round here
                I swear it's only bad bitches 'round here
                I mean it's only real niggas 'round here
                You know it's only real niggas 'round here
                I said, only bad bitches 'round here
                I swear it's only bad bitches 'round here
                I mean it's only real niggas 'round here
                You know it's only real niggas 'round here, I said
                I been gettin' too fuckin' drunk nigga
                High, been gettin' too fuckin' blunted lately
                I just keep true, share one with you
                Blame, that liquor but it's how the world made me
                I been movin' too fast I need to slow down
                Said, too many things that I shouldn't say
                Hey, just point out anywhere you wanna go now
                Now, I swear these niggas don't know what it takes
                Only bad bitches 'round here
                I swear it's only bad bitches 'round here
                I mean it's only real niggas 'round here
                You know it's only real niggas 'round here
                I said, only bad bitches 'round here
                I swear it's only bad bitches 'round here
                I mean it's only real niggas 'round here
                You know it's only real niggas 'round here, I said
